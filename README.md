Rocket Golf VR for UWyo COSC 4950/5
=========================================

This is nothing more than a directory structure to use for starting a new project.  
It contains the following folders:

* **Source:** This is where you should place all of your source code.  If your project
  uses multiple languages, you may find it useful to have subdirectories, e.g.,
  Source/java, Source/html, Source/images, etc.  If you are using an IDE that has
  a project directory, you may wish to start the project here.  For example, the
  Source directory could contain an Xcode project repository or a VisualStudio
  project.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.  This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company.  That is a good example of what a requirements document for this
  class should look like.

* **Resources:** This is where you can place files that are useful to your project.
  For example, you may place here helpful articles downloaded from the internet.

Before you turn in a project, be sure to modify this file!  It should have:

Rocket Golf VR

Project Description:
Our idea was to make a game for google cardboard. In our group meeting we named this game “Rocket Golf”, based off of the game rocket league if you have heard of it. The overall premise of the game would be that you would use a car to play a game of golf. To make this idea more interesting we wanted to make this game using google cardboard and use an engine like unity or unreal 4 so we could incorporate VR into our project and then also make use of some type of android game controller so a player could be “immersed” into the world and control their car with a gamepad. Ideally we broke our project down into 3 sections varying in difficult so we could adjust what the final product looked like based on how far we progressed. It broke down as follows:

1.       A fully working game running in google cardboard using some type of controller as our input device

2.       Multiplayer support so that two people with android phones could play against each other in real time or maybe turn based

3.       Leaderboards, achievements, etc to make the app feel even more polished
